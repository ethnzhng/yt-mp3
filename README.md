# yt-mp3

A simple and user-friendly CLI tool for downloading a YouTube video as an MP3 file (in maximum quality), and optionally applying helpful modifications to the output file, including:
- Adjusted volume
- Metadata:
  - Track title
  - Artist
  - Album title
- Cover art, from:
  - YouTube thumbnail (default)
  - A local image
  - A URL to an image


I created this primarily with my personal use case in mind â€” to simplify and streamline the process of downloading songs for my Spotify Local Files.

### Prerequisites

FFmpeg is needed for the MP3 conversion, and must be installed before running the tool. 

On macOS:

```sh
brew install ffmpeg
```

### Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ethnzhng/yt-mp3.git
cd yt-mp3
pip install .
```

### Usage

> [!TIP]
> I find that the audio extracted from a majority of YouTube videos typically has a high relative volume compared to native Spotify songs. So in these cases it is useful to lower the volume of the output MP3, e.g. `--volume 0.8` to reduce the perceived volume to ~80%.

```sh
# Show usage and options
yt-mp3 --help

# Download a song, add some metadata, and use a high-resolution image from the internet for the cover art
yt-mp3 \
    --output-name "dont_cry" \
    --output-dir ~/Downloads \
    --title "Don't Cry (Demo Version)" \
    --artist "Guns N' Roses" \
    --volume 0.8 \
    --art-url "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91yJCdQKDaL._UF1000,1000_QL80_.jpg" \
