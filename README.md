# yt-mp3

A simple and user-friendly CLI tool for downloading a YouTube video as an MP3 file (in maximum quality), and optionally applying helpful modifications to the output file, including:
- Adjusted volume
- Metadata:
  - Track title
  - Artist
  - Album title
- Cover art, from:
  - YouTube thumbnail (default)
  - A local image
  - A link to an image


I created this primarily with my personal use case in mind â€” to simplify and streamline the process of downloading songs for my Spotify Local Files.

### Prerequisites

FFmpeg is needed for MP3 conversion, and must be installed before running. 

On macOS:

```sh
brew install ffmpeg
```

### Installation

```sh
pip install .
```

### Usage

```sh
yt-mp3 --help
```

#### TODO: demo example

I find that the audio extracted from a majority of YouTube videos typically has a high relative volume compared to native Spotify songs. Thus, in these cases it is useful to lower the volume using the volume option, e.g. `--volume 0.8` to reduce the perceived volume to ~80%.
